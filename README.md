# MDE Compare
## A comparison of Markdown environments.

The purpose of this repository is to find out how different Markdown software renders the same input in different ways, and how that compares to how it is rendered on websites like GitHub or Bitbucket.

As I'm currently looking for a preferably free (or otherwise cheap) MD editor for Mac to replace the one I've been using so far, my own research will be limited to those for now. The file I'm testing the various editors with is also limited to markup whose output I've found differs the most in different software (namely bullet points, code blocks and line break variations).

Anyone is welcome to contribute by uploading own screenshots of software they are using, testing or actively developing, or by adding additional syntax (markup they feel should be included also) to the test file - though it might be a while until previously tested software gets re-tested with new versions of the file.
